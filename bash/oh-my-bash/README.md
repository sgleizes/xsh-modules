# Oh-My-Bash module

This module provides an integration with
[oh-my-bash](https://github.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash) for demonstration purposes.
It comes with the default OMB configuration taken from the
[provided template](https://github.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash/blob/master/templates/bashrc.osh-template).

To migrate your OMB configuration to xsh, you can copy this module and
apply your customizations to `@interactive.bash`.
