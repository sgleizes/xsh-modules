# Zplug module

This module provides an integration with
[zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug) for demonstration purposes.
It comes with a basic configuration inspired from the
[README](https://github.com/zplug/zplug#example).

To migrate your zplug configuration to xsh, you can copy this module and
apply your customizations to `@interactive.zsh`.

You can load zplug first and split your zplug commands in multiple modules,
along with your customizations.
Just don't forget to run `zplug check/install/load` in the last module, or use a
dedicated module for that.
